## `How do I ask a good question?` :boom:

**You need to check first if there is an answer before you ask a question. (Search, and research)**
1. Write a title that summarizes the specific problem.
2. Spelling, grammar and punctuation are **important!**
3. If you're having trouble summarizing the problem, **write the title last.**
4. Due to security reasons do not write your personal info, and be objective.
5. Introduce the problem before you post any code...
6. Help others reproduce the problem:  **don't just copy in your entire program!** 
7. **DO NOT use images of code.** 
8. Use Stack Snippets to include runnable HTML, JavaScript, or CSS.
